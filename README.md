This software was developed by the Brigham and Women's Department of Medicine Quality and Safety Team.

The intent of this code is to be used as part of a larger workflow to automate the processing of large volumes of safety reports from healthcare institutions using a basic natural language processing (NLP) methodology of heuristic keyword mapping.  Mapped categories can then be used to drive logic which can create enriched cohorts of reports for review.

The code provided is an R-markdown file and requires an installation of R and RStudio to run.  Please refer to these sites on help to install R and RStudio.

The expected input is an Excel file (generally exported from safety reporting software/database) and the output is also an Excel file.
